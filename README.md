## Description
This project implements integrations for Web2 games using APIs to obtain game statistics and a data verification mechanism based on zero-knowledge proofs.
## Solution Proposal: StatSync Duel — A Competitive Gaming Stats Integration Platform

### Concept Overview
**StatSync Duel** transforms in-game competition into a social and engaging wagering experience for popular games like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Call of Duty. By streamlining game stats retrieval while ensuring privacy and data integrity through zero-knowledge proofs, players can challenge each other in real-time, placing p2p wagers on their skills in a transparent format.

### How it Works:

1. **Create a Challenge**:
   - Player 1 initiates a challenge by selecting a game, setting a wager amount, and creating a unique challenge link.
   - The link dynamically unrolls on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and X, providing a preview including game info, wager amount, and a "Join Challenge" button.

2. **Link Verification**:
   - Upon sharing the challenge link, Player 2 can view the challenge details and is required to connect their gaming account (e.g., Riot Games for League of Legends).
   - Player 2 clicks on the link and is directed to a verification page where they authenticate their account via OAuth based on the chosen platform's API.

3. **Stat Retrieval Using API**:
   - Once verified, StatSync uses the game’s API to fetch real-time statistics of both players (e.g., K/D ratio, win rate).
   - The integration takes advantage of caching strategies to ensure low-latency access to frequently requested stats for speedy gameplay.

4. **Zero-Knowledge Proof (zkProof) Implementation**:
   - To ensure privacy, the actual statistics aren't sent over the network—rather, zkProofs verifying key stats (e.g., if Player 1’s K/D ratio is higher than Player 2’s) are generated.
   - zkProof guarantees both players that the statistics are authentic and prevents direct knowledge of the underlying data.

5. **Engagement and Execution**:
   - After successful verification, both players are taken back to the challenge page to finalize the wager deposit via UPI, crypto (e.g., USDT, SOL), or stablecoins.
   - Once funds are secured, players engage in a live game, with the winner determined based on the originally set in-game metrics.

6. **Payouts and Feedback Loop**:
   - Post-match, a smart contract instantly executes the payout to the winner's wallet.
   - Players can rate their experience, and high-rated players can earn rewards or badges, fostering community and credibility.

### Technologies and Frameworks:
- **Game APIs**: Riot Games API, Epic Games API, Steamworks API for real-time data fetching.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Use frameworks like ZoKrates or zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving verification.
- **Web Technologies**: Leverage Node.js or Python Flask for backend services, integrating with Web3 wallets for crypto transactions.
- **Database**: Store user profiles and challenge history securely using MongoDB, ensuring scalability and fast access.
- **Social Media Integration**: Implement Discord.js and Telegram API for bot-driven challenge announcements and updates.

### Example Challenge Flow:
1. **Player 1** creates a duel on the StatSync platform, wagers 10 USDT, and creates a link.
2. The created link is posted in a Discord channel as: "Dare to take on the challenge? [Join the Duel](challenge-link.com)!"
3. **Player 2** clicks the link, verifies their identity and gaming stats on the platform.
4. The system fetches and verifies stats via the Game API and zkProof mechanism while ensuring privacy.
5. After successful challenge acceptance, both players deposit the wager, play, and the system resolves and announces the winner with payout features.

### Conclusion
With **StatSync Duel**, you can integrate seamlessly with popular Web2 games, leveraging real-time APIs and zkProof for the ultimate secure and engaging wagering experience. This innovative approach not only boosts the gaming community's thrill but also strengthens camaraderie and competitive spirit, redefining how players engage with their favorite titles.
